Superuser System Command(s), System Command(s) Gesture(s), Description(s), and Provision(s)

The Magic Clap System Command Gesture:

All the people I give permission to, while I give permission to, can do whatever they want intended, and described, given, within the limits of the user’s authorization(s), authorization level(s), role(s), legality, and the permission(s) granted to the user, and any way, they want to, and the government, and public, don’t decide to, and don’t still get to tell them what to do, if what they want to do is legal, and safe enough to don’t cause a major injury, and, or, pain, and stays healthy enough to don’t harm the environment, in a noticeable way, long term,  they like clap, and describe, whatever, and, o, r like clap and every task they want to have performed is performed a single time due to the describing, at a time when is the soonest contextual opportunity affords, then the participants return to their natural state of behavior, behaving in the ways they would without me giving another task for them to perform, which is like how they want to, or instinctively do, whichever is more natural, like in the best shortest practical easiest way, and like stays within my authorization when doing things, all types of authorization, permission, consent, relevant given to me, stuff like my roles, and socioeconomic status, and social network, and if they don’t want the task(s) they clapped to before or gave, or performed, a system command to perform the task(s) for to continue they think about the thing, and clap two times, I can to

The So, and So, Stop, System Commands:

When I say so, whatever task I say to do is done by performing the task, with whatever tools the best choice in terms of relevancy, and utility, out of the within the user(s) I am authorized to decide the scheduling, by the The So, and So, Stop, System Commands system command description, of the specific task(s), in question, within the limits of the user I am’s authorization(s), authorization level(s), role(s), legality, and the permission(s) granted to the user, for, and in-network technology, I’m authorized to, and which is legal to perform the specific task(s), in question, in the way(s) which the specific task(s) scheduled performance by the The So, and So, Stop, System Commands containing system command declaration, if initialized with a system command catalyst, will be scheduled to be performed if, and when, the system command given is still scheduled to be performed, and wasn’t invalid in, and the system command declaration isn’t of an invalid system command syntax, system command syntax, if the tasks won’t be aren’t allowed to be performed due illegality in, or of, the performance of the specific task(s), in question, if the performance is predicted to be, or proved to be, illegal to be performed, or to have, an illegality in, or of, the performance, when the performance is, or would, or are, be, if the performance of the specific task(s), in question, would be, or are, allowed to be, when, in specific, they are scheduled to be, performed, have whatever permissions granted to, or consent given to, or own, or is public technology which like is approved of using with the in-network devices, specifically that of the strictest policy, and the network policy, but like staying within my authorizations like staying within all types of authorization, permission, consent, relevant given to me, stuff like my roles, and socioeconomic status, and social network, and whoever’s down like without having to ask but independently prefers to in respects to specifically myself asking for the task to be done, also like I don’t have to give a system command confirmation if I don’t want to but like the task won’t be scheduled to be performed if I change my choice to have the task performed if the task hasn’t been performed yet, and I aren’t down anymore for the task to be performed, also when I say so stop and like describe some tasks I have like done a system command for the performance of the task(s), and, or, a system command gesture for the performance of the task(s)

The Magic Snap System Command Gesture:

Performed, or given, as the words, magic snap, with a system command confirmation, performs the preceding system command(s), or system command gesture(s), within the limits of the authorization(s), authorization level(s), role(s), permission(s) granted, consent given, to, and of, the user(s), and within the limits of legality, which are down for the task(s) associated with the system command(s), or system command gesture(s), to be performed with the specific parameters, such as the user(s) which are chosen as the fulfillment of the target(s) parameter of the system command(s), or system command gesture(s)

Superuser System Commands Healing:

Healing by way of the magic clap and describing so, always stays within governmental regulation, painless, comfortable, healthy, legal, and successful or I notice why wouldn’t be completed successfully, and does the healing in like the shortest practical doable amount of the time which is at least a single second, and I like get notified when a system command starts healing something or someone and like how long that will take and if completes or fails

Superuser Noticing:

I notice the things the system commands and system command gestures want me to notice by telling myself out of my own mouth what I was going to notice that the system command or system command gesture wants me to notice, within the limits of legality, and of the protected privacy and access to protected information laws in respects to myself, the information, and who and what has the information being leveraged
