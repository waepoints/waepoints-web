# Referencing And Defining
The system and what the system has been extended to, isn’t able to be referenced or defined by users the owners of the system doesn’t still approve of doing so and can’t do so against their own safety, the users which matter to the owners of the system’s safety or mine, or any number of the options listed, and users can’t reference or define, the system or what the system has been extended to, or have done by an action, against the owners of the system’s safety or the users which matter to the owners of the system’s safety, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level and proper authorization

# When the system wants to have the user notice…
In the Waepoint System Standards, the phrase “the user notices” is replaced by “the user tells themselves out of their own mouth”, or if impractical to do so, or types, or if impractical, or fingerspells or uses signs they will understand in and from American Sign Language at a comfortable, and healthy, to both the user, and the user’s current property, and doesn’t detract from the safety of and for what’s in the user’s possession, speed, if they want to still, but first the user feels the inkling to for a few seconds, and if they still want to and are safe, and healthy, to do so for the duration of the message without question, in a new note in the right very, very easily disposable place to do so, unless impractical to do so, otherwise, the user isn’t notified until a later time when is practical to do so, if they still want to know about the information they were to notice

# Individual Event Memory Loss and Preservation
If a single memory of an event or a number of memories of of an event or events will be affected or forgotten by use of the system for the affected user or users, the default choice when such would occur is to only have forgotten or affected the the memories which won’t be thought about by the user or the users individually or referred to by another user, other users, either of the two, later and now in the users’ affected individually’s lifetimes, the user or affected users individually are prompted through noticing with the option to do so at the time, and if the prompt is declined, the system abandons the system interaction which would affect the user or cause the user to forget the memory or memories of the event or the number of events, or if the prompt is approved then additionally, the user is prompted through noticing that the memories can be brought back with whichever of the Restore… First Aid System Commands is more relevant for the user, and make the strongest recommendation the system is capable of for which First Aid System Command will help restore their forgotten memory best, and if the prompt is declined or approved the system proceeds accordingly, and when healing attempts are initiated for different ages, memory and brain structure and content is only interacted with through the system by the Individual Event Memory Loss and Preservation provision’s provisions relative to the user’s current experiential age versus the user’s desired age in body, though memory interactions, being made to forget an event and memory preservation through the system isn’t able to be left unhealthy at the end of the interaction, but must leave the user stable, healthy, and with the user’s best level of cognitive faculty achievable by the system and the users affected individually in the interaction and an unquestionably well working mind and a well working memory, mind and body with the changes to the user’s memory explicitly and/or intrinsically determined by the user which can be done with the user being stable, healthy, cognizant and with the users desired, essential, and the memories which will come to the user’s thoughts now or later in life or be referred to to the user by other users or the user’s self in life, retained and accessible, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level and proper authorization

# While Still Of Use
The system only has still tracking for the system speech tracking has still tracking for the system command speech tracking and still has stacked for the system speech stacked  and system speech only stays stacked while the system speech is still useful to be tracking and stacked to the users involved, unless the stacked system speech is secured, also if stacked as a definition of the device(s), endpoint(s), Waepoint(s) or system(s), or the standardized Standard Definition from the README.md file of the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s files, giving priority to the owners of the system to have system speech stay tracking and stacked over others if such a decision presents, and above that giving users defending themselves against illegal activity over the illegal violent action performers, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level and proper authorization

# Volume and Comfort
In interactions with the system, devices, mapping, users, volume and comfort of the users interacting are always within acceptable levels for the users interacting, and word choice isn’t alterable from intended word choice and avoids application of effects applied to increasing the feeling of anger
