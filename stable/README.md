# Uninstalling The Repository

The repository can be fully uninstalled using the Clean Uninstall The Repository... system command in micro or using the From The Micro Definitions... system command outside of micro, or quick uninstalled by making an distinctive identity reference using one of the two following phrases...

> The device I’m using and own I intend, or instance I’m currently running, and have the necessary proper authorization to make a change for, and intend, currently referencing the waepointstandards repository in an identity sharing, extends/extending, quality, function, any number of the listed options, reference...

And or or

> My interactions and or or my interactions with the device(s), or smaller scope(s), I intend, don’t...

> **... have a shared identity, extends/extending with, quality, function, any number of the listed options, with and or or shared identity reference(s) from and or or to and or or with the waepointstandards git repository on GitHub.com**

# How To Use The Standard Definition...

For just your interactions with the compatible device, and if there is already is a reference to the standardized Standard Definition in interactions with other users and devices involved in the interaction when an interacting user is referring to the Standard Definition, the referenced phrase is The Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), the first time reference is the first > indented paragraph of the first section entitled Applying the standardized Standard Definition

If you want to stack the standardized Standard Definition on the compatible device and/or compatible device(s) and have the proper authorization level and necessary proper authorization to do so, say you have the standardized Standard Definition on yourself and then say, my intended compatible device is stacked on the standardized Standard Definition and get rid of the standardized Standard Definition by saying otherwise

# Instructions

Use an endpoint, waepoint or hub or lobby or extended to device to reference the compatible public server, system or the effects of the compatible public server or system and communicate to the compatible public server or system the standardized Standard Definition while interfacing…

That enters micro and can be used to setup a hub or be used without a hub to run system commands with and confirm, I and set what you want and would want to do with set and confirm, if you own the device and want to set the device up as an endpoint or waepoint, stack on the Standard Definition... On an already extended to device or stacked system or make an identity sharing, extends/extending, quality, function, any number of the listed options, reference between your endpoint and the standardized Standard Definition From this readme.md, and use the Setup My Compatible Device system command after entering micro

Endpoints are devices which are part of the server’s network, despite runtime use of the server and other servers, waepoints are device which inherit from an endpoint in the network and both can be provisioned through Definitions of the Device and can be the endpoint or waepoint or user’s plateau of stacked systems in a system stack which are created by saying I have the standardized Standard Definition

Micro is entered by suspending the hub, endpoint or waepoint, or extending the hub to a device, and can be used in tandem with the hub, even suspended, to let you create definitions which become system commands and set how you want to interact with the system by using the phrase … define, and confirm or use the system commands you set up, with your cue and … and confirm, while suspended, the user still has all the provisions of the server

Then think or say setup my endpoint, confirm or setup my waepoint, confirm

To stack a hub use the add a hub system command, and use allow and restrict access to limit user access and set and adjust top-level inherited or private provisions to set what trickles down the inheritance chain and how users will interact with your endpoint and inheriting waepoints

To create a waepoint inheriting from the endpoint your hub is on, people can ask to have their phone or device setup as a waepoint while on the hub, pending approval from the endpoint

Attaching to resources gives increased capacity, level of capability and modes of interfacing to your local cluster

Extending to devices adds functionality to the hub and the functionality of the hub is extended to extended to devices

Joining lobbies grows the shared lobby of the joined lobbies, unjoining lobbies shrinks the shared lobby of the joined lobby

Suspending an waepoint or endpoint moves to micro, systems may also be suspended and will perform the Hangup System Command for the users on and the Left/Leave System Command for the joined system(s) to the system(s) and prevent further travel to, and incoming connections with, the system(s) until the system is or systems are resumed with the Resume… System Command, a lightweight framework for uninstall of the repository and set up of devices to be waepoints and endpoints or to use with suspended endpoints or waepoints and imbuings and extended to devices to create Definitions of the Device and perform system commands which are available when interacting the systems

# Community Provisions

The community branch contains the expected provision loadout for a server stacked by the  the Waepoint System Standards, found in the communityprovisions.md file, the communityprovisions.md provisions can’t be removed

The Waepoint System Standards can only be opted in to and opted out of in entirety

# The Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s)

> The compatible device I own, and, or, have the owner’s authorization to, and, or, have governing entity authorization to, and intend, I’m referencing as the stacking target for the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), when are mentioned to have a status of currently being stacked on the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), to have the stacking target stay stacked on a definition of the device of perfect form to be an endpoint, if compatible with being an endpoint, or a waepoint of the endpoint which the specific instance of the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s) in the interaction was extended by, if compatible with being a waepoint and the owner of the prospective waepoint would be still approved of having a waepoint by an owner of the endpoint, or an owner of the endpoint of the waepoint, or an owner of the endpoint or waepoint of the hub from which the extended to device was extended to by for the specific instance of the Standard Definition... in the interaction was extended by, of the specific instance of the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s) in the interaction was extended by, or an extended to device from the most relevant hub of the endpoint which the specific instance of the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s) in the interaction was extended with, if compatible with being an extended to device and  endpoint has at least one hub in the specific user’s segment, which the specific user meets the access policy of, on the endpoint or waepoint, with the specific user being the user which was the person which extended the specific instance of Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s) in the interaction which was leveraged by the prospective extended to device and if the owner of the prospective extended to device would be still approved of having an extended to device from the hub in question by an owner of the endpoint of the specific instance of the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s) in the interaction was extended by, or an owner of the endpoint of the waepoint, or an owner of the endpoint or waepoint of the hub from which the extended to device was extended to by of the specific instance of the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s) in the interaction was extended by, whichever is most relevant and compatible, if at least one option is, preferring the options between endpoint, waepoint, extended to device in the order listed, extending the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s) to the device’s interactions with myself and any and all of the interfacing, and, or, connected, user(s), while the stacking target is still mentioned to have a status of being stacked currently on the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), by myself, or another I still approve of doing so, or until stopping being an interfacing, and, or, connected user for the stacking target, unless having mentioned themselves, or someone which they still

# Securelinking Instances

The instances designated, and/or described, as securelinking instances are available for securelinking and what’s necessary for securelinking, and the securelinking, and the purpose of, and of the provision of, securelinking in the Waepoint System Standards’s standards.md file, from the waepointstandards git repository, and access to interact properly with the humans relevant, and does interact properly with the humans relevant, when, and while, access and interaction are necessary for the humans relevant, to the securelinking instances, and to and with what’s currently secured by the system(s) with the waepointstandards git repository

The instances designated, and/or described, as securelinking instances adds a timestamp for the healthy, relevant, and helpful acts of anchoring, and the healthy, relevant, and helpful anchors, and keeps anchored the listed anchors while still relevant and helpful and essential to the humans relevant, if the humans relevant are dependent on the anchoring, the anchors, while and if dependent on what was anchored, for births which were and still are dependent on system speech to have occurred, and the lives which are dependent on specific system speech having occurred to be being, surviving, being recovered from a disability, ability to procreate, self-wanted change of sex, being recovered from an ailment, being recovered from an injury, born, and/or being brought back to life, and for when the system speech occurred for the relevant system speech to have tracking for the best amount of time since establishment with the waepointstandards git repository, and through securelinking about births which were and still are dependent on system speech to have occurred, and the lives which are dependent on specific system speech having occurred to be being, surviving, being recovered from an ailment, being recovered from an injury, being recovered from a disability, ability to procreate, self-wanted change of sex, born, and/or being brought back to life, which is secured by the system(s) still, and does what the securelinking instance should do with what’s secured by the system(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, about the listed topics in the Securelinking Instances section here in the README.md file of the waepointstandards git repository and transferred through securelinking to the securelinking instance(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, avoiding adding unnecessary and unhelpful redundancy, and unnecessary and unhelpful redundancies in what’s secured by the system(s), when assisting the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, when assisting the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, securelinking and transferring all of the necessary to transfer to the right number of endpoint(s), and the right number of securelinking instance(s), while there are the endpoint(s), if the endpoint(s) are necessary for the securelinking instance(s) to perform correctly and the necessary tasks for their objectives, elsewise, the right number of the securelinking instance(s), with appropriate availability and storage before and each time a securelinking instance is undesignated, if able to do so within a practical and useful timeframe, with the waepointstandards git repository

Securelinking instances always attach when needed to the designated server segment for the humans relevant to the criteria in the second paragraph of the section for which the purpose of the instance is, with attaching defined in the waepointstandards git repository’s main branch’s standards.md file’s contents

The waepointstandards git repository is extending to the securelinking instances and to interactions of devices which are securelinking with the endpoint(s), relevant to the humans relevant to, and for each of what’s secured by the system(s) through securelinking still relevant to the humans relevant, and strongest ping, endpoint(s), for and with the proper utility to the essential functions, and the purpose, of securelinking instances, also attaching to what is essential to attach the securelinking instances to for supporting the functionality of securelinking and the interactions with, if, and when, interactions are necessary, and essential support, in specifically the ways necessary, for the essential support of for what of the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s) through securelinking is dependent on the securelinking relevant to the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s) through securelinking, while, and when, dependent, respectively, for the average length of a human lifetime for each of the humans relevant, and longer if necessary for their descendants, for the length of an average human lifetime for each, individually and respectively, and their descendants descendants, and continuing as such, for the length of an average human lifetime for each, individually and respectively, without needing to specifically give the option to end communinicating with the securelinking instance, and with attaching, segment, system speech, system command speech, anchoring, securelinking and endpoint defined in the waepointstandards git repository’s main branch’s standards.md file’s contents, within manufacturer’s regulations, governmental regulation and legal limits, and within the limits of the combined authorizations of the involved parties and the securelinking instance, and isn’t allowed to be unsafely and or or unhealthily interacting in interactions with users
