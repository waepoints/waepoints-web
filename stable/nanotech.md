Guideline Groups

Guideline groups are categories of guidelines which the person with the compatible implanted device can do have or don’t have the references in relation to the compatible implanted device based on the person with the compatible implanted device’s own self’s mentioning to do so

[Base Guidelines]

[The compatible implanted device in me has bracket references to the implanted device, avoid the first attempt at being cleared made within six seconds seconds unless cleared by a direct reference to the reference or to a group of references which do contain brackets every reference or are cleared by the a clean uninstall the repository from/on… system command, and aren’t altered by their use, and only are altered by performing a clean uninstall the repository from/on… system command or the act of dereferencing which is myself suggesting “the implanted device doesn’t still reference…” by any appropriate words, and a reference or some references which ceases the reference being still referenced by the compatible implanted device, which occurs if and when the dereferencing is done by myself, or if I am being caused harm by a bracket reference my implanted device references then the bracket reference causing the harm to me is dereferenced until the bracket reference is updated to where the bracket reference doesn’t cause harm to myself and only if the bracket reference isn’t dereferenced still by myself, and are elevated over all other references, indirect and direct, in the priorities of the device above the use of them]

[The compatible implanted device in me references, or doesn’t still reference, the symbol or custom guideline category name references, but may only reference the symbol or custom guideline category name references while also the bracket references, and when and while I mention my nanotech to have or to don’t have, or does or doesn’t reference, or still or is still or won’t or don’t still reference or references, and the symbol or custom guideline category name guidelines or guides or a description of a guideline, by any appropriate words]

[The compatible implanted device in me references the bracket references I mention to reference or add as a base or fixed or bracket guideline or guide or mention as is a base or fixed or bracket guideline or guide or have the base or fixed or bracket guideline or guide, optionally with a symbol or custom category or at least is part of or is in a symbol or custom category with the word base or fixed or bracket, and doesn’t still reference the bracket references I mention as dereferenced or mention as aren’t or isn’t still referenced or aren’t or isn’t or aren’t still or isn’t still a base or fixed or bracket guide or guideline or aren’t or isn’t or aren’t still or isn’t still a guide or guideline or don’t have or don’t still have the base or fixed or bracket guideline or guide, optionally with a symbol or custom category or or at least isn’t part of or isn’t in a symbol or custom category with the word base or fixed or bracket, by any appropriate words]

[The compatible implanted device in me references the parentheses references I mention to reference or add as an optional guideline or guide or add as a guideline or guide and don’t mention as a base guide or guideline in the same phrase or mention as is an optional guideline or guide or is a guideline or guide and don’t mention base guide or guideline in the same phrase or set or set as an optional guideline or guide or set as a guideline or guide and don’t mention as a base guide or guideline in the same phrase and doesn’t still reference the parentheses references I mention as dereferenced or mention as aren’t or isn’t still referenced or aren’t or isn’t still an optional guideline or guide or aren’t or isn’t still a guideline or guide, by any appropriate words]

[The compatible implanted device in me references the dollar sign references I mention to reference or add as an guidance guideline or guide or mention as is an guidance guideline or guide or mention as set or set as a guidance guideline or guide and doesn’t still reference the guidance references I mention as dereferenced or mention as aren’t or isn’t still referenced or aren’t or isn’t still a guidance guideline or guide or aren’t or isn’t still a guideline or guide, by any appropriate words]

[The compatible implanted device in me references the tilde sign references I mention to reference or add as an first aid guideline or guide or mention as is an first aid guideline or guide or mention as set or set as a first aid guideline or guide and doesn’t still reference the first aid references I mention as dereferenced or mention as aren’t or isn’t still referenced or aren’t or isn’t still a first aid guideline or guide or aren’t or isn’t still a guideline or guide, by any appropriate words]

[The compatible implanted device in me references the grouped in a custom group of references I mention to reference or add as a guideline and name a custom category or guide or mention as is a guideline or guide and name a custom category or mention as is a guideline or is a guide and name a custom category or add as a guideline or guide and name a custom category or set or set as a guideline or guide and name a custom category and doesn’t still reference the category of the guideline’s references I mention as dereferenced or mention as aren’t or isn’t still referenced or aren’t or isn’t still a guideline or guide and name the category of the guideline or aren’t or isn’t still a guideline or guide, by any appropriate words]

~ Recommended First Aid Guidelines ~

The Recommended First Aid Guidelines aren’t had by default

~ When tracking interactions or healing interactions by the compatible implanted device in me, is initiated and is using what would be considered a misuse or gross excess of power consumption and/or battery percentage if battery operated or cost to the to the owner of the battery, and/or me, if I’m responsible for paying the cost incurred or the device conducting the tracking interaction or healing interaction is pertinent to and/or is the compatible implanted the device in me, the compatible implanted device in me doesn’t continue the tracking interaction or healing interaction with the compatible implanted device in me, and has me notice if I am in less than healthy, stable health  ~

~ Healing attempts initiated through the compatible implanted device in me go as expected or better or aren’t attempt initiated or continued if initiated but rather, returned to a status of health stability if able to be returned to a status of health stability ~

~ The compatible implanted device in me gets foreign objects, which are from open wounds, and if specified explicitly, other foreign objects from the body, out of the body first when healing, through the shortest route, avoiding the surfaces beneath and around the body as well as solid objects in the path of extraction which aren’t clothing, and restricting clothing for the object to leave the body and stay out of the body, and heals any damage caused by the removal of the foreign object or foreign objects, and/or resultant damage of, after extracting the foreign object or foreign objects ~

~ The compatible implanted device in me doesn’t heal wisdom teeth and/or already healed wounds unless mentioned to do so explicitly when mentioned to heal ~

~ The compatible implanted device in me avoids healing from death or undoing death when too many bad things will happen as the result of doing so ~

(Recommended Optional Guideline)

The Recommended Optional Guidelines aren’t had by default

(Through the compatible implanted device in me, if I didn’t authorize the use of the implanted device in my by the entity doing so without me being aware of their use of the implanted device recently and remember doing so, I have awareness of their use by noticing what they are doing with the implanted device in me and who of proper authorization authorized them to do so or if they have the proper authorization level and what the authorization level is)

(The compatible implanted device in me, lets the others I would want to be hearing me which want to hear my voice hear what I want them to of hear of my voice while and when I want them to hear my voice which they would welcome and my voice isn’t unwelcome to continue being heard when heard by them presently until the conversation is over, and we go without hearing each other’s voices for the time being, which they’d be open to hearing, and I intend them to hear, and hear what they want me to of their voice while I would want to be hearing their voice and what they are saying, while and when they want me to be hearing their voice which I would welcome and their voice isn’t unwelcome to continue being heard by me when heard by me presently until the conversation is over, and we go without hearing each other’s voices for the time being, which they’d be open to me hearing, and they intend me to hear and at the volume we each want to hear, respectively, and well enough to discern words, until there is a want by the person hearing to stop hearing the voice of the person which the voice is being heard or wants to stop hearing the voices of each other both ways)

(The compatible implanted device in me, gives me awareness of when others want to hear my voice to start a conversation by noticing their first name, last initial and municipality, and how I know them if I do, or if I don’t how they know of me and how to know to want to hear my voice)

(The compatible implanted device in me, lets others notice offers to have them do specific things which are made apparent to the point of informed consent if they agree to the offer, and also lets them stop doing the things or things remaining which would’ve continued as the result of accepting the offer by any way they choose to which isn’t barred by the ellipses references the implanted device references or my own stipulations still approved of by my own self and lets me notice when and if they accept or deny the offer, aren’t able to accept the same offer more than once and aren’t able to change the answer after a time period I wouldn’t agree with or if I wouldn’t agree with the change)

(The compatible implanted device in me, lets those I want to and would welcome or which want me to and I would welcome can say a message to me or I can say a message to them, when the preparer of the message expresses a desire verbally to send a message with my nanotech, say a message and express a desire verbally to send the message, which is noticed at the right time for the message and the message’s contents or isn’t noticed if the message isn’t practical to be noticed and welcome within a useful period of time, also an option is abandoning the initiation of message sending attempt if the message preparer says to do so by any phrase of matching intent to abandon the initiation of the message sending attempt, and the message sender notices if the message never is noticed by the recipient or isn’t noticed within the expected timeframe by the recipient and when the message will be if the message will be)

(The compatible implanted device in me, gives me intuition about when I initiate attempts to do things which won’t be similar enough to what I expect for my sensibilities, which are barred by stipulations of the bracket references my compatible implanted device references or of my own setting and still approved of by my own self, and when processes I’m saying I want to do finish and if they were successful)

(The compatible implanted device in me, does and has tracking while doing the things I say, or fingerspell, when and while I want to and won’t fail and while still useful to me and still does good or enhances or as long as they take if that’s less time than the other two time limits, while and if the compatible implanted device in me is described by myself as listening in or through nanotech.md or nanotech md, but does so within the limits of my current and my compatible implanted device in me’s current authorization levels, groups, roles, and authorizations and permissions granted)
